        <h2>brian ramesar</h2>
        <p>My name is Brian ramesar, my coding journey technically started 
            when i was handed the Lambda school pre-course work, since then (late Jan)
            I've completely immersed myself in everything programming. Since then, i've learned 
            so much nmot only just about Web development but in game design with the C language, 
            and A.i with the Python language. though it an be overwhelming at times i find that having
            a strong motivational source helps greatly.
